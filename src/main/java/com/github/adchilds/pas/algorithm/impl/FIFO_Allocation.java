/**
 * This class implements a First-In-First-Out algorithm for page allocation. It requires the

 * that represents the number of available frames in the system.
 * 
 * This algorithm will return a 2D array of integers that represent the frame allocation after
 * each page reference is made. It is also capable of returning the number of page faults that
 * occurred during a specific run through the algorithm or at any point during it.
